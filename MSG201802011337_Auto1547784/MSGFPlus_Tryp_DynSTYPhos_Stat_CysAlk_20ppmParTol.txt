#Parent mass tolerance 
#  Examples: 2.5Da or 30ppm
#  Use comma to set asymmetric values, for example "0.5Da,2.5Da" will set 0.5Da to the left (expMass<theoMass) and 2.5Da to the right (expMass>theoMass)

#Modifications (see below for examples)
StaticMod=C2H3N1O1,    C,  fix, any,       Carbamidomethyl       # Fixed Carbamidomethyl C (alkylation)

#Fragmentation Method
#  0 means as written in the spectrum or CID if no info (Default)
#  1 means CID
#  2 means ETD

#  4 means Merge spectra from the same precursor (e.g. CID/ETD pairs, CID/HCD/ETD triplets)

#Instrument ID
#  0 means Low-res LCQ/LTQ (Default for CID and ETD); use InstrumentID=0 if analyzing a dataset with low-res CID and high-res HCD spectra
#  1 means High-res LTQ (Default for HCD; also appropriate for high res CID).  Do not merge spectra (FragMethod=4) when InstrumentID is 1; scores will degrade
#  2 means TOF
#  3 means Q-Exactive
InstrumentID=1

#Enzyme ID
#  0 means No enzyme used
#  1 means Trypsin (Default); use this along with NNET=2 for a no-enzyme search of a tryptically digested sample
#  2: Chymotrypsin, 3: Lys-C, 4: Lys-N, 5: Glu-C, 6: Arg-C, 7: Asp-N, 8: alphaLP, 9: No Enzyme (for peptidomics)

#Number of allowed C13 peaks
#  Takes into account that 2nd or 3rd isotope may have been chosen for fragmentation
#  If 1, then considers expPeptideMass-1.00335
#  If 2, then also considers expPeptideMass-2.00671
#  Useful for accurate precursor ion masses
#  Ignored if the parent mass tolerance is > 0.5Da or 500ppm
C13=2

#Number of allowed non-enzymatic termini
#  The number of allowed peptide termini that are not cleaved by the enzyme (default 1)
#  For trypsin, 0 means fully tryptic only, 1 means partially tryptic, and 2 means no-enzyme search
NNET=0

#Target/Decoy search mode
#  0 means don't search decoy database (default)
#  1 means search decoy database to compute FDR (source FASTA file must be forward-only proteins)
TDA=1

#Include decoy peptides (only applicable when TDA=1)
#  0 means to not include decoy (reverse) peptides
#  1 means to include decoy PSMs after all target (forward) PSMs

#Amino Acid Frequencies
#  If 0, compute amino acid frequencies from the input database and use them as amino acid probabilities
#  If 1, use uniform amino acid probability (preferable when the database size is small)
#  If auto, then Analysis Manager will auto-set this to 0 if the the .Fasta file is more than 20 KB in size

#Amino Acid Modification Examples
# Specific static modifications using one or more StaticMod= entries
# Specific dynamic modifications using one or more DynamicMod= entries
# Modification format is:
# Mass or CompositionStr, Residues, ModType, Position, Name (all the five fields are required).
